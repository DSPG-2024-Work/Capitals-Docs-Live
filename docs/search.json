    "text": "Overview\nIn our project, we seek to explore the relationship between community capital indicators and the overall condition of communities in Iowa, aiming to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and gaps within these communities. The main work focuses on major events such as natural disasters, job losses, new job creation, school closures, and new opportunities for tourism and healthcare. The study seeks to identify the most relevant community capitals, trends over time, and the impact on community resiliency, by analyzing correlations between various indicators and comparing quantitative data with some qualitative insights.\nThat aside, we also seek to develop a comprehensive database of significant events, using sources such as the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), Iowa Economic Development Authority Board minutes, and weather disaster summaries. The Data analysis will include exploring relationships within and between different community capitals, and visualizing findings using dashboards created in Shiny or Tableau. The overall goal is to provide a tool for stakeholders to better understand and enhance community resiliency and quality of life.\n\nProject Description\n\nProject Summary\nWhat do the community capital indicators tell us about a community? Community strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, gaps, etc.\nHow well do the identified indicators tell us about the condition of a community in relationship to the community capitals?\n\n\nProject Scope\n\nDatabase of major events in Iowa communities (natural disasters, plant closings/major job loss, new plant opening/jobs created, school closures/school district mergers, closure of state-run hospitals and nursing care facilities, new opportunities for tourism – music festival, bike trails, recreation, etc., opening of new hospitals/care facilities)\nData analysis:\n\nCorrelations between indicators – including relationship of indicators within and between capitals as well as with different peer groupings (population, RUCC)\nTrends and change over time.\nComparison to qualitative data and use as – visioning, RHRA, small towns poll.\nWhich three capitals are most related (ex: if interested in built capital – which two others might be most relevant to understanding built?)\n\nDashboard – tableau\nResiliency fit into capitals.",

To calculate our measure of interest (Cultural_Locations_per_10k), we used the following steps:\n\nExtracted city/county population data from the American Community Survey (ACS).\nDivided the total number of cultural locations in each city/county by the population of the corresponding city/county.\nMultiplied the results by 10,000 to express the number of cultural locations per 10,000 people.\n\nThus, the final measure Cultural_Locations_per_10k was obtained using this formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cultural\\_Locations\\_per\\_10k} = \\frac{\\text{Total Number of Cultural Locations}}{\\text{Population}} \\times 10,000\n\\]",
